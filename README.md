# <RKT-code-refactor>

## Description

- I refactored the code for Horiseon to clean up the HTML and CSS, making the website more accessable for all users.
- I replaced semantic tags and fixed CSS selectors and kept the layout and view of the site the same as it was previously. 
- I fixed the "Search-engine-optimization" button so that it is functioning
- I added notes in HTML and CSS files to show what changees I have made to the code. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
